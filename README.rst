cl-spasm
========

A Common Lisp port of Hiccup, Clojure's HTML-building, vector- and map-based
library.

"Port" may be too strong a word, though... perhaps "heavily inspired by".
Additional inspiration was taken from Twisted's stan syntax for representing
HTML as S-expressions. Additionally, spasm includes some of the functionality
provided by hickory (Clojure).
